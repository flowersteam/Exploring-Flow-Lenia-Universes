## Overview

The project presents a systematic approach for discovering diverse ecosystem-level emergent properties in complex systems using Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes (IMGEP). This methodology is extended to explore evolutionary dynamics at the system level, using Flow-Lenia—a continuous cellular automaton with mass conservation and parameter localization—as a test case. The work demonstrates how goal-directed exploration can efficiently navigate vast parameter spaces to identify conditions promoting open-ended evolution.

Key aspects include:
*   Modifications to Flow-Lenia to better support multi-species evolution.
*   Evaluation of systems using simulation-wide metrics: evolutionary activity, compression-based complexity, and multi-scale entropy.
*   An interactive exploration tool to complement automated discovery, creating an effective human-AI collaborative workflow for scientific investigation.

## Key Contributions

*   Extension of IMGEP as a systematic discovery tool for ecosystem-level emergent properties in complex systems, applied to uncover diverse evolutionary dynamics in Flow-Lenia.
*   A multi-metric approach to evaluating evolutionary dynamics, combining evolutionary activity, complexity measures, and multi-scale entropy analysis.
*   Discovery of diverse evolutionary phenomena suggesting ecological interactions.

## Visualization Tool

An interactive visualization tool is available to explore Flow-Lenia's evolutionary dynamics. Users can examine parameter configurations, emergent behaviors, and evolutionary metrics discovered by IMGEP.

The visualization tool will be free to use and modify once the paper is published.
